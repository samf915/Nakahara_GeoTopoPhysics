# Nakahara: Geometry, Topology, and Physics
These are my incomplete hand-typed notes as I read through the second edition of Nakahara's Geometry, Topology, and Physics. They contain summaries of all sections in the book (that I've read so far) as well as solutions to certain exercises. I am uploading them here in case they may be of service to other students reading the text. In general, Nakahara explains things quite well, but there are certain calculations that I add more detail to. Please email me at frank.sam@northeastern.edu if you have any questions or notice anything wrong.
